Code:You Web Development Keystone Project: KQ Fashion Site

As some context, I completed Code:You's Data Analysis cohort in December 2023. In that time, I created the small business idea of selling hand-designed shoes to collect data from titled [Kicks Quest](https://github.com/JodieMullins/KicksQuest). This repository is a continuation of that idea, showcasing a small website acting as a client-side application for customers to browse custom shoe selections and input a contact form as necessary. 

DISCLAIMER: This site purposefully does NOT implement a full shopping cart utility at this time, and no real payments may be processed. 


This repository utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create what a small website may look like.
