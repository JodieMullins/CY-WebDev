Code:You Web Development Keystone Project: KQ Fashion Site

As some context, I completed Code:You's Data Analysis cohort in December 2023. In that time, I created the small business idea of selling hand-designed shoes to collect data from. This repository is a continuation of that idea, showcasing a small website acting as a client-side application for customers to input custom shoe orders. 

This repository utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create what a small website may look like. 

Features utilized in this project: 

[x] Responsive Design {Best Practice}

[] Integrate a third-party API into your project. {REQ}

[x] Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc) {Intermediate}

[] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) {Intermediate}

[] Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc). {Intermediate}

[] Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g. table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop, calendar-date-picker, etc) {Intermediate}
