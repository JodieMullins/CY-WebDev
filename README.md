Code:You Web Development Keystone Project: KQ Fashion Site

As some context, I completed Code:You's Data Analysis cohort in December 2023. In that time, I created the small business idea of selling hand-designed shoes to collect data from. This repository is a continuation of that idea, showcasing a small website acting as a client-side application for customers to input custom shoe orders. 

This repository utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create what a small website may look like. 

Features utilized in this project: 

[x] Responsive Design {Best Practice}
[] Integrate a third-party API into your project. 
[x] Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc) {Intermediate}
