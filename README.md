# Code:You Web Development Keystone Project

## KQ Fashion Site

To provide context, I completed Code:You's Data Analysis cohort in December 2023. In that time, I created the small business idea of selling hand-painted shoes from which to collect sales data, titled [Kicks Quest](https://github.com/JodieMullins/KicksQuest). 
This repository is a loose continuation of that, showcasing a basic website acting as a client-side application for customers to browse customized shoes and input a contact form. 

DISCLAIMER: This site purposefully does NOT implement a full shopping cart utility at this time, and no real or fake payments may be processed. All images have been created using generative AI services, such as wombo/dream, and no real products are available through this proof of concept.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository utilizes HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create what a website may look like across browser and mobile views. Node.js and Express allowed me to morph the simple web page into a complete web application capable of making API calls and persisting data as necessary.

Features within this project: 

- [] Responsive Design {Best Practice} [All Pages]

- [] Integrate a third-party API into project. {REQ}

- [] Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app. {Easy} [Seasonal]

- [x] Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc) {Intermediate} [Home]

- [x] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) {Intermediate} [Promo]

- [] Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc). {Intermediate} [Contact]

- [] Interact with a database to store and retrieve information (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, etc). {OPTIONAL} {Intermediate} 

- [] Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js or Fastify.  Serve at least one route that your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file). {OPTIONAL} {Easy/Intermediate}
