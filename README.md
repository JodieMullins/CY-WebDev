# Code:You Web Development Keystone Project

## KQ Fashion Site

As some context, I completed Code:You's Data Analysis cohort in December 2023. In that time, I created the small business idea of selling hand-designed shoes from which to collect sales data, titled [Kicks Quest](https://github.com/JodieMullins/KicksQuest). 
This repository is a loose continuation of that, showcasing a basic website acting as a client-side application for customers to browse custom shoe selections and input a contact form. 

DISCLAIMER: This site purposefully does NOT implement a full shopping cart utility at this time, and no real or fake payments may be processed. All images have been created using generative AI services, such as wombo/dream, and no real products are available through this proof of concept.
